# Welcome to the DECH Stack
The DECH Stack is a powerful open-source observability platform designed to revolutionize the way you manage and configure your observability data. Comprising four essential components - DotOptic, Elastic, Cassandra, and HDFS - this stack empowers users to seamlessly orchestrate and centralize their observability configurations.

## About DotOptic
At the heart of the DECH Stack is DotOptic, an open-source API server meticulously crafted for configuring observability data with unparalleled ease and efficiency. DotOptic specializes in "Configuration as Code," allowing users to define their observability settings in a single, version-controlled YAML file stored in a GitHub repository.

## Configuration as Code
With DotOptic, you can specify a unique configuration ID, much like a YAML file in a GitHub repository. This ID acts as a focal point for all your observability configurations, ensuring that your settings are consistent, organized, and readily accessible. DotOptic automatically detects changes in your GitHub repository, ensuring that your observability configurations remain up-to-date without manual intervention.

## Seamless Synchronization
One of the standout features of the DECH Stack is its ability to maintain perfect synchronization between your GitHub repository and DotOptic's configuration dashboard. When you update your configuration settings from the dashboard, DotOptic seamlessly pushes these changes to GitHub, ensuring that your "Observability as Code" is always current and accurate.

## Core Services
While DotOptic plays a central role in the DECH Stack, it collaborates seamlessly with Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and PostgreSQL to deliver a robust and comprehensive observability solution. These services work in unison to provide a seamless and efficient platform for managing your observability data.

Experience the future of observability management with the DECH Stack, where Configuration as Code meets automation, and observability becomes a breeze. Dive into our documentation to get started and unleash the full potential of your observability journey.
